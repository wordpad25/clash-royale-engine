    <p>This is my blog for my Clash Royale Engine. Here, I'll post update notes and my plans to continue and extend this project.</p>
    <p><a href="index.html" style="color:white">Back to home page...</a></p></p>
    <h2 class="full-width" style="background-color: #f0f080">8/12/20 - Getting Rects</h2>
    <p>Just added a patch to the engine! Now the King and Princess towers have rectangular collision with spells. That is, NT projectiles and T projectiles wil work as though they have a rectangular collision, but melee units and mass calculations will use the original circular collision.</p>
    <p>Also patched a fringe issue with Log - now it should work more reliably. And Log got its additional .5 tile removed now that rectangular collision is working and it doesn't need it.</p>
    <p>All in all, solid updates that should improve system accuracy and reliability.</p>
    <p>In other news, check out my full blog here: <a href="https://blog.scholarlygaming.vercel.app/index.html" style="color: white">https://blog.scholarlygaming.vercel.app/index.html</a></p>
    <p>UPDATE: Added 6 more Classic decks, including 3 from Season 14 and 3 from Season 12. Added 6 Retro decks that will work with Retro mode.</p>
    <h2 class="full-width" style="background-color: #f0f080">8/4/20 - Site Update!</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, I haven't gotten a lot of time to work on this lately. But very shortly I'm going to have a lot of free time. I know this could use some updates, so I will provide them.</p>
    <p>First step; tonight I made some site-wide updates. Added this section in so that I could post updates here. And I improved the headers and got rid of that bottom scrollbar that's been bothering me for a while.</p>
    <p>Balances should be in tonight as well. Personal opinion: I think these were pretty fair in most cases. Although I think that spells in general weren't the problem - Rocket was. I'd have just reduced the Crown Tower damage for it. And that Miner nerf was probably a bit overkill... All in all I'm expecting a Beatdown-focused meta.</p>
    <p>Anyway, with that said, I plan on working on the card creation tool a bit more shortly - expect some updates next week. And there's some changes that I need to make to the towers. Square collision might take me a while, but it is definitely needed. And I should probably make some other fixes.</p>
    <p>In terms of other projects, I kind of want to make a more personal blog as well. (Yes, this is a blog, but I want to keep this for things relating to this project and Clash Royale in general.) That'll take some time, as I want to add some better HTML to that. Because in terms of HTML... well... I could use some work on that.</p>
    <p>Well, I'm off to nerf the Miner. I'll add something here when I'm able to start work on the next round of updates.</p>
    <p>UPDATE - Balances completed! Sorry for the downtime for the past hour (11PM EST) - arrays are hard. Log is 0.5 tiles longer than it should be - otherwise it cannot hit the tower without rectangular collision. Again, will fix that soon and will then update Log to fix it.</p>
