 * Version options:
 * 
 * "current" - Stats as they are in the live game / confirmed balance stats for the live game(as such, might be a bit ahead - if we're in the pre-balance weekend and you want live data, you'll need to use a legacy version). These stats WILL see changes as time goes on. I will try not to break these stats, but it may happen if I'm adding new cards, or if there's a significant rework, so you've been warned.
 * "legacy-MMYY" - Stats as they were in the month MM of the year 20YY. Currently supported for October 2019 and later. As you go back, cards will get removed, so make sure you use a time-appropriate deck. Relative stability guaranteed for all existing legacy versions - no edits will be performed unless there is a problem.
 * "retro" - Card stats, excluding Mirror, have been set to their stats as of Clash Royale's original release. Mirror now no longer creates Level 10 cards(hardcoded). Cards newer than the original release have been removed, so pushes will likely fail, and you will need to enter a valid deck. Stability is guaranteed here - there will be no edits. Note that most cards have recieved massive changes. For your convenience, following is a list of all of the 42 cards you can use: 
 * {Spear Goblins, X-Bow, Knight, Giant, Musketeer, Skeletons, Cannon, Wizard, P.E.K.K.A., Mini P.E.K.K.A., Baby Dragon, Minions, Minion Horde, Goblins, Bomber, Elixir Collector, Witch, Goblin Hut, Tombstone, Inferno Tower, Prince, Barbarians, Archers, Fireball, Arrows, Rocket, Zap, Freeze, Valkryie, Giant Skeleton, Balloon, Bomb Tower, Golem, Rage, Goblin Barrel, Mortar, Barbarian Hut, Hog Rider, Skeleton Army, Lightning, Tesla, Mirror
 }
 * "dev" - Includes current game stats as well as speculative/new card ideas and balances. (Hence, dev.) Don't be surprised if you see some new mechanics and cards here, or if something here is completely broken - this channel has no stability guarantee. New cards will be added in a convenient list when I choose to add any, which I haven't.

/**
 * Three notes for visibility:
 * 
 * 1. If you have made a mod for this game, and you would like to update to the current version, just copy over your changes. Everything should be backwards-compatible. Please tell me if something does break.
 * 2. If you have created a new card for this game, I would be more than willing to add it to a dev version or something similar here. (Providing credit to you, naturally.)
 * 3. I will likely add an in-game deck changing feature and some new push features due to people's requests. Thanks for your feedback!

/**
 * Started on September 21st, 2019
 * 
 * Release R1.0.0: 1-4-20, 3:35 PM
 * Welcome to my Clash Royale engine! Here, you can use any card you want, in any deck you want, and make any change that you want - all with just a little bit of edits!
 * Also has Push Mode, multiple arenas, card information screens, and elixir settings.
 * Contains a completely new mode as well - Retro Version! Sets everything back to January 2016 stats. See how different the game was back then!
 * Release R1.0.1: 1-4-20, 8:35 PM
 * Fixed Firecracker's load time
 * Release R1.0.2: 1-7-20, 10:25 AM
 * Added sight range stat to info screen, added rounding to fire rate stat, fixed Firecracker again
 * Release R1.0.3: 1-7-20, 11:05 AM
 * Added fix to allow for any size of screen (Note: May decrease framerate somewhat if not 600x600)
 * Release R1.0.4: 1-8-20, 11:10 AM
 * Added search feature to allow you to replace the cards in your deck! Type the card you want and the slot you want to put it into(in your order - 0 is the top-left of your hand, 1 is the top-right, 2 bottom-left, 3 bottom-right, 4 is the next card). Then, press ENTER, and the selected player's card will be replaced in their deck! Also fixes load time rounding(info).
 * Release R1.0.5: 1-12-20, 9:00 AM
 * QOL'd info screen some more, added air-targeting troops (NOTE - Air-targeting troops will attack and target towers, as if such a troop launches, there'd be no point in having it otherwise, so...) Also added a troop debug tool - troops that have some stats issues (IE - their HP is not their max HP, their range is more than their sight range...) that are likely input errors will put warnings in the chat. Also updated search tool. Also added fix to Dart Goblin. Added small patch to allow for deathElixir to give different amounts of elixir.
 * Release R1.0.6: 1-22-20, 9:15 AM
 * Fixed Firecracker again, made spread tag for NT projectiles, fixed Miner glitches
 * Release R1.1.0: 2-3-20, 9:00 AM
 * Added in February 2020 balance changes. Fixed legacy Barbarian Hut and Witch. Added January 2020 legacy version. Fixed a lot of load times.
 * Release R1.1.1: In Progress
 * Fixed the defender ability to act more like the EWiz. Fixed sight range in stats to get rid of the extra 0s at the end. Fixed projectile collision to allow for faster projectile speeds without glitches occuring.
